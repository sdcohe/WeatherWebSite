Radiological Hazard Warning|(RHWBRO)|	

    Issued for other radiological hazards, which may or may not include effects from nuclear power plants.

Evacuation Immediate|(EVIBRO)|	

    Issued for immediate evacuation. Could be used for tropical cyclone evacuation messaging.

Fire Warning|(FRWBRO)|	

    Issued for imminent threat of wild fire encroaching on populated areas, requiring immediate evacuation or protection.

Shelter in Place Warning|(SPWBRO)|	

    Issued for instant need to shelter in place due to imminent danger in area.

Volcano Warning|(VOWBRO)|	

    Issued for imminent danger from volcanic ash or lava flows.

Tsunami Warning|(TSUAT1/TSWBRO)|TS.W
	

    Issued by the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (ATWC) if a strong earthquake (magnitude 7.0 or greater) occurs which may generate a potential tsunami (imminent or expected) with significant widespread inundation. Offices in the tsunami warning area will issue via EAS either a Civil Emergency Message (CEM) or a Tsunami Warning message (TSW) on NOAA Weather Radio. Offices in the tsunami warning area will also issue a Special Weather Statement every 30 minutes in order to provide timely updates while the tsunami warning is in effect.

Tsunami Watch|(TSUAT1/TSABRO)|TS.A
	

    Issued to alert emergency management officials and the public of an event which may later impact the watch area. The watch area may be upgraded to a warning or advisory – or canceled – based on updated information and analysis. Therefore, emergency management officials and the public should prepare to take action. Watches are normally issued based on seismic information without confirmation that a destructive tsunami is underway.

Tsunami Advisory|(TSUAT1/CEMBRO)|TS.Y
	

    Issued due to the threat of a potential tsunami which may produce strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or near the water. Coastal regions historically prone to damage due to strong currents induced by tsunamis are at the greatest risk. The threat may continue for several hours after the arrival of the initial wave, but significant widespread inundation is not expected for areas under an advisory. Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include closing beaches, evacuating harbors and marinas, and the repositioning of ships to deep waters when there is time to safely do so. Advisories are normally updated to continue the advisory, expand/contract affected areas, upgrade to a warning, or cancel the advisory.

Tsunami Information Statement|(TIBAT1)|	

    Issued to inform emergency management officials and the public that an earthquake has occurred, or that a tsunami warning, watch or advisory has been issued for another section of the ocean. In most cases, information statements are issued to indicate there is no threat of a destructive tsunami and to prevent unnecessary evacuations as the earthquake may have been felt in coastal areas. An information statement may, in appropriate situations, caution about the possibility of destructive local tsunamis. Information statements may be re-issued with additional information, though normally these messages are not updated. However, a watch, advisory or warning may be issued for the area, if necessary, after analysis and/or updated information becomes available.

Short Term Forecast|(NOWBRO)|	

    Designed to give specific, detailed forecast information for the next 2 to 6 hours for a specified location, outside of the routine but generally falling below criteria necessary for a Significant Weather Advisory (SPS). For example, an unforecast area of scattered showers expected to last an hour or two would meet the criteria for a short term forecast.

Hazardous Weather Outlook|(HWOBRO)|	

    Issued to highlight possible hazardous and/or severe weather threats for the next week (7 days) associated with convective weather, tropical weather, coastal and marine threats, winter weather, high winds, heat, etc. Weather threats that would be included are those that would be expected to reach the level that poses a threat to lives and/or property, and typically require the eventual issuance of a watch, warning, advisory, or statement .
